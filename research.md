<!-- My research focuses on designing "sensory" and "motional" behaviors of mobile robots in more "informative" ways for each other. 
In particular, I propose novel *machine learning* approaches to address problems under realistic challenges. 
Several research topics in which I've been directly involved are listed below, but I have a broader interest in improving *autonomy* of *embodied AI systems*. -->

## Synthesis of Realistic Anomalies 

I am interested in creating anomaly detectors using "only" normal, typical observations, which are more accessible and cost-effective to obtain. For instance, in the context of automating fruit health monitoring from image data, it can be challenging to collect sufficient samples of unhealthy fruits. Even if you have some examples, completely novel types of disease could arise later, posing new challenges for detection.
To overcome this, I develop methods to leverage the normal samples to *synthesize* hypothetical but realistic examples of anomalies so that these synthetic anomalies can serve as valuable training data for accurate anomaly detection.
In other words, my research aims to enhance monitoring systems by bridging the gap between limited anomaly data and the need for comprehensive anomaly detection solutions.
Specifically, I have shown novel techniques that utilize *self-supervised learning* and *generative adversarial networks* to tackle practical scenarios like *fruit health monitoring* üçì and *ant behavior analysis* üêú. 
<!-- Similarly, taking motions for promoting "outlier" states has also been found useful for speeding-up *robotic learning*! -->

## Informative Path Planning

Mobile robots could be a useful instrument to regularly monitor an area of interest and report any change of a particular spatial phenomenon there, e.g., soil temperature, humidity, or compaction in agricultural applications. However, their paths for sensing must be optimised to navigate only to most "informative" locations for spatial prediction &mdash; instead of planning to visit every grid cell  &mdash; due to limited resources, such as battery lifeüîã and mission time‚è∞. *Gaussian Process Regression* has been widely used in literature since it enables 1) information-theoretic evaluation of candidate locations and 2) online learning as a new measurement is acquired. My interest lies in integrating such traditional methods with more modern *deep learning* algorithms to better optimise the robotic sampling paths.

## Multi-robot Coordination via Teammate Modeling

A team of robots could do much more than a single robot could. For strategic team maneuvers, *communication* is the key feature for them. What would then be the best way of communication? You can imagine explicit signals of particular messages, but we, as humans, often use "implicit"  communication by, for example, showing some simple gestureüëã with the hope that our co-worker understands what we actually meant by it. For enabling such communication, I've worked on robotic algorithms to model the "mapping" from some *indirect* *observations* to *actual* *motions* of teammates so that individuals after learning could take complementary actions to others'. As an application, I've introduced so-called *Remote Teammate Localization (ReTLo)* problem, in which a robot is to infer poses of distant teammates only from observations of a nearby robot to proactively maneuver for the team.
