Dr. Taeyeong Choi is an Assistant Professor of [Information Technology](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/it/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University (KSU)](https://www.kennesaw.edu/), GA, USA. 
Leading the *Learning and SEnsing Research (LaSER)* laboratory, his research primarily focuses on designing novel machine learning and robotics methodologies for practical applications domains, such as agriculture. 
<!-- To be specific, he is interested in developing new approaches  -->
His research involves the development of data-driven approaches to construct precise environmental models, addressing challenges posed by limited available observations. 
<!-- I design algorithms to synthesize useful data that could complement an available, imperfect dataset so as to better model the world of interest.  -->
<!-- Additionally, I build embodied agents capable of optimizing their motions and paths to collect the most informative observations.  -->
Dr. Choi's work is built upon cutting-edge advancements in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and robotics technologies. 

Prior to joining KSU, Dr. Choi gained valuable research experience as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Davis, under the guidance of [Dr. Xin Liu](https://xinliu.engineering.ucdavis.edu), and at the University of Lincoln, UK, supervised by [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak). 
During these positions, he specialized in the development of AI/robotics technologies for agri-food systems, identifying unique domain-specific challenges and creating effective solutions.
Through active collaboration, he led the organizing team of the [ICRA2023 workshop on Agri-Food Robotics--from Farm to Fork](https://sites.google.com/view/icra23tig4ws/), contributing to the research community. 

He earned his PhD in Computer Science from Arizona State University, working under the supervision of [Dr. Theodore Pavlic](https://search.asu.edu/profile/1995237). 
His cross-disciplinary doctoral research, which included the design of a deep learning-based abnormal state detector in ant colonies, were recognized with the ASU Completion Fellowship as well as the Best Paper Award in the SWARM2021 conference.

<!-- we believe that *agri-robotics* will be one of the most important 
fields in the near future, and so, we are working to identify the unique challenges and limitations in traditional approaches to propose new, better solutions.
In this research direction, I design mobile robots that can *learn* from data to perform useful decisions in various scenarios &mdash; navigation to right positions, detection of environmental anomaly, or cooperation of robot teammates. 
I am aware of the struggles of current state-of-the-art approaches to robotic learning in scenarios where learned knowledge has to *continuously generalize* or *adjust* to new environments, or to be *clearly explained* in the human-understandable manner; these challenges may actually become even more severe if the focal system scales up to operate a large number of robots simultaneously for the tasks.
Thus, I am very happy to be part of the AI/Robotics community to invent novel solutions to bring real robots to our physical lives as early as possible, and for doing that, I am also actively looking for new collaborations. -->

<!-- Prior to the current position, I was a postdoc at the [Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology
](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/liat/) of University of Lincoln, UK, where [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak) was my supervisor. 
Before that, I finished my PhD in Computer Science at Arizona State University in 2020, under the supervision of [Dr. Theodore (Ted) Pavlic](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/1995237).  -->
<!-- You can check out my dissertation [here](https://search.proquest.com/openview/315da7f3afc6956f0befeee8568d5246/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), in which I primarily proposed the interesting view of multi-agent systems as a monolithic agent to predict useful global properties from local observations for decision making.
I utilized not only multi-robot teams but ant colonies (*Not ant colony optimization! Real ants!* 🐜) as testbeds to validate AI systems under realistic constraints. 
In fact, the ASU Graduate College recognized the significance of this research to provide the *Completion Fellowship* &mdash; a full financial support for my last semesters &mdash; while I was finalizing it. 
I still have some ongoing works as interesting extensions, and I will also try to post the updates in this website. -->
