I am a postdoctoral research associate at the 
[Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology (LIAT)](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/liat) 
at [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home), UK, in which 
I mainly work with [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak) to 
build more advanced robotic systems in *agricultural* domains.
In particular, we believe that *agri-robotics* will be one of the most important 
fields in the near future, and so, we are working to identify the unique challenges and limitations in traditional approaches to propose new, better solutions.
In this research direction, I design mobile robots that can *learn* from data to perform useful decisions in various scenarios &mdash; navigation to right positions, detection of environmental anomaly, or cooperation of robot teammates. 
I am aware of the struggles of current state-of-the-art approaches to robotic learning in scenarios where learned knowledge has to *continuously generalize* or *adjust* to new environments, or to be *clearly explained* in the human-understandable manner; these challenges may actually become even more severe if the focal system scales up to operate a large number of robots simultaneously for the tasks.
Thus, I am very happy to be part of the AI/Robotics community to invent novel solutions to bring real robots to our physical lives as early as possible, and for doing that, I am also actively looking for new collaborations.

Prior to the current position, I finished my PhD in Computer Science at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), USA, in 2020, under the supervision of [Dr. Theodore (Ted) Pavlic](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/1995237). You can check out my dissertation [here](https://search.proquest.com/openview/315da7f3afc6956f0befeee8568d5246/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), in which I primarily proposed the interesting view of multi-agent systems as a monolithic agent to predict useful global properties from local observations for decision making.
I utilized not only multi-robot teams but ant colonies (*Not ant colony optimization! Real ants!* üêú) as testbeds to validate AI systems under realistic constraints. 
In fact, the ASU Graduate College recognized the significance of this research to provide the *Completion Fellowship* &mdash; a full financial support for my last semesters &mdash; while I was finalizing it. 
I still have some ongoing works as interesting extensions, and I will also try to post the updates in this website.

I am always watching all my communication channels. Please feel free to reach out through any method you can find below, if you would like to discuss anything. Thanks!
