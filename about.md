<!-- <span style="color:red">[*Major update coming soon ...*]</span>. -->
I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/) and 
the [AI Institute for Food Systems (AIFS)](https://aifs.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California, Davis (UCD). 
I work with [Dr. Xin Liu](https://xinliu.engineering.ucdavis.edu) to develop practical AI and robotics solutions to improve *agri-food* systems by addressing unique domain-specific challenges in applying the methods assumed to be performing well. 
Prior to joining UCD, I was also a postdoc at the [Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology
](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/liat/) of University of Lincoln, UK, where I was supervised by [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak). 

My research interests lie in the development of novel deep-learning methods for creating precise environmental models, even in scenarios with the limited resources for data gathering. 
To be specific, I design algorithms to synthesize useful data that could complement an available, imperfect dataset so as to better model the world of interest. 
Additionally, I build embodied agents capable of optimizing their motions and paths to collect the most informative observations. 
These studies leverage cutting-edge research in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and robotics. 

*Exciting News!* Starting in the Fall semester of 2023, I will be starting a new role as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Information Technology](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu) at Kennesaw State University (KSU). 
I look forward to continuing to extend my research activities through active collaborations with new students and colleagues. 
If you are interested in working with me, don't hesitate to reach out at [taechoi@ucdavis.edu](mailto:taechoi@ucdavis.edu).

<!-- we believe that *agri-robotics* will be one of the most important 
fields in the near future, and so, we are working to identify the unique challenges and limitations in traditional approaches to propose new, better solutions.
In this research direction, I design mobile robots that can *learn* from data to perform useful decisions in various scenarios &mdash; navigation to right positions, detection of environmental anomaly, or cooperation of robot teammates. 
I am aware of the struggles of current state-of-the-art approaches to robotic learning in scenarios where learned knowledge has to *continuously generalize* or *adjust* to new environments, or to be *clearly explained* in the human-understandable manner; these challenges may actually become even more severe if the focal system scales up to operate a large number of robots simultaneously for the tasks.
Thus, I am very happy to be part of the AI/Robotics community to invent novel solutions to bring real robots to our physical lives as early as possible, and for doing that, I am also actively looking for new collaborations. -->

<!-- You can check out my dissertation [here](https://search.proquest.com/openview/315da7f3afc6956f0befeee8568d5246/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), in which I primarily proposed the interesting view of multi-agent systems as a monolithic agent to predict useful global properties from local observations for decision making.
I utilized not only multi-robot teams but ant colonies (*Not ant colony optimization! Real ants!* 🐜) as testbeds to validate AI systems under realistic constraints. 
In fact, the ASU Graduate College recognized the significance of this research to provide the *Completion Fellowship* &mdash; a full financial support for my last semesters &mdash; while I was finalizing it. 
I still have some ongoing works as interesting extensions, and I will also try to post the updates in this website. -->
