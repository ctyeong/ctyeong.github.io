<!-- <span style="color:red">[*Major update coming soon ...*]</span>. -->
I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/) and 
the [AI Institute for Food Systems (AIFS)](https://aifs.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California, Davis. 
I mainly work with [Dr. Xin Liu](https://xinliu.engineering.ucdavis.edu) to build practical AI and robotics solutions to improve *agri-food* systems while identifying unique domain-specific challenges in applying the methods assumed to be performing well.
*In particular, I will be starting a new position as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Information Technology](https://ccse.kennesaw.edu) at Kennesaw State University in the Fall semester 2023 to continue to extend my studies with new students and collaborators!* 

I am interested in developing novel deep-learning methods to create precise environmental models while the resources for data gathering are limited. 
To be specific, I design algorithms to generate useful data that could complement an available, imperfect dataset so as to better learn the world of interest. 
Furthermore, I build embodied agents that can autonomously optimize their motions/paths to gather most informative observations. 
For these studies, I leverage the theories and latest research in computer vision, reinforcement learning,  and robotics.

<!-- we believe that *agri-robotics* will be one of the most important 
fields in the near future, and so, we are working to identify the unique challenges and limitations in traditional approaches to propose new, better solutions.
In this research direction, I design mobile robots that can *learn* from data to perform useful decisions in various scenarios &mdash; navigation to right positions, detection of environmental anomaly, or cooperation of robot teammates. 
I am aware of the struggles of current state-of-the-art approaches to robotic learning in scenarios where learned knowledge has to *continuously generalize* or *adjust* to new environments, or to be *clearly explained* in the human-understandable manner; these challenges may actually become even more severe if the focal system scales up to operate a large number of robots simultaneously for the tasks.
Thus, I am very happy to be part of the AI/Robotics community to invent novel solutions to bring real robots to our physical lives as early as possible, and for doing that, I am also actively looking for new collaborations. -->

<!-- Prior to the current position, I was a postdoc at the [Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology
](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/liat/) of University of Lincoln, UK, where [Dr. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/gcielniak) was my supervisor. 
Before that, I finished my PhD in Computer Science at Arizona State University in 2020, under the supervision of [Dr. Theodore (Ted) Pavlic](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/1995237).  -->
<!-- You can check out my dissertation [here](https://search.proquest.com/openview/315da7f3afc6956f0befeee8568d5246/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), in which I primarily proposed the interesting view of multi-agent systems as a monolithic agent to predict useful global properties from local observations for decision making.
I utilized not only multi-robot teams but ant colonies (*Not ant colony optimization! Real ants!* 🐜) as testbeds to validate AI systems under realistic constraints. 
In fact, the ASU Graduate College recognized the significance of this research to provide the *Completion Fellowship* &mdash; a full financial support for my last semesters &mdash; while I was finalizing it. 
I still have some ongoing works as interesting extensions, and I will also try to post the updates in this website. -->
